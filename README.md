# LDC2D
2 Dimensional Lid Driven Cavity

This code was created and used as a demonstration script intended to illustrate:
a) the lattice Boltzmann method for isothermal, viscous, laminar fluid flows; and
b) CUDA as a way to use GPUs to accelerate scientific computations.

The repository is now in a state such that it should work provided you have some version of the CUDA toolkit installed.
